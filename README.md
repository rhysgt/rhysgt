### Hello world! 👋

I'm a Senior Application Scientist at the Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, based at The University of Manchester.

As a materials scientist, I'm interested in understanding deformation mechanisms and the effects of irradiation on metals, with a particular interest in zirconium, titanium, tungsten, and iron alloys. By integrating nanoscale strain mapping (HR-DIC) with crystallographic orientation mapping (EBSD) using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using [DefDAP](https://github.com/MechMicroMan/DefDAP), we can gain deeper insights into the behavior of these materials.
